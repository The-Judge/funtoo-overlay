To update your existing installation of dokuwiki successfully, you have to
accomplish the following tasks.
All these are described in [1], too (see URLs below).

    1) Make a backup of your DokuWiki, this is not necessarily needed but
       recommended.
    2) Update your local copies of web-apps/dokuwiki to this new version by
       using webapp-config.
    3) Read the changelog [2] to see if there are any special things to consider.
    4) Delete all unused files [3].
    5) Upgrade the configfiles if necessary. If there are any additional
       steps, portage will ask you to do so (by running etc-update or
       similar).
    6) Upgrade your template [4] and plugins [5] if necessary.
    7) Wait for a day for update notifications to go away, or speed the
       process by following the steps in Update Check [6].

Next, check the config

    Finally, test if everything is set up correctly. Use the check option in a
    URL and pull it up into a browser:

    http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}/doku.php?do=check

You're done! Have fun using your wiki!
